## Synopsis

List supported Rubies and their known stable versions:

    $ ruby-install

For newer [unknown versions][issue198] follow the 'recently released' install steps below.

Install the known current stable version of Ruby:

    $ ruby-install ruby

Install a known stable version of Ruby:

    $ ruby-install ruby 1.9

Install a known specific version of Ruby:

    $ ruby-install ruby 1.9.3-p429

Install a recently released version of Ruby not known by ruby-install:

    $ ruby-install --md5 MD5_OF_TAR_BZ2 ruby 2.3.4

There are also `--sha1`, `--sha256` and `--sha512` options. Specify one or more
checksums to validate.

Install a Ruby into a specific directory:

    $ ruby-install --install-dir /path/to/dir ruby

Install a Ruby into a specific `rubies` directory:

    $ ruby-install --rubies-dir /path/to/rubies/ ruby

Install a Ruby into `/usr/local`:

    $ ruby-install --system ruby 1.9.3-p429

Install a Ruby from an official site with directly download:

    $ ruby-install -M https://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.0.0-p247

Install a Ruby from a mirror:

    $ ruby-install -M http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.0.0-p247

Install a Ruby with a specific patch:

    $ ruby-install -p https://raw.github.com/gist/4136373/falcon-gc.diff ruby 1.9.3-p429

Install a Ruby with a specific C compiler:

    $ ruby-install ruby 1.9.3-p125 -- CC=gcc-4.7

Install a Ruby with specific configuration:

    $ ruby-install ruby 2.0.0 -- --enable-shared --enable-dtrace CFLAGS="-O3"

Uninstall a Ruby version:

    $ rm -rf ~/.rubies/ruby-2.2.0

### Integration

Using ruby-install with [RVM]:

    $ ruby-install --rubies-dir ~/.rvm/rubies ruby 2.0.0-p247

Using ruby-install with [rbenv]:

    $ ruby-install --install-dir ~/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p247 ruby 2.0.0-p247

ruby-install can even be used with [Chef].

## Install

    wget -O ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz
    cd ruby-install-0.5.0/
    sudo make install

### PGP

All releases are [PGP] signed for security. Instructions on how to import my
PGP key can be found on my [blog][1]. To verify that a release was not tampered
with:

    wget https://raw.github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/master/pkg/ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz.asc
    gpg --verify ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz.asc ruby-install-0.5.0.tar.gz

### Homebrew

ruby-install can also be installed with [homebrew]:

    brew install ruby-install

Or the absolute latest ruby-install can be installed from source:

    brew install ruby-install --HEAD

### FreeBSD

There is a [FreeBSD port] of ruby-install which can be copied into the local
ports tree.

## Known Issues

### Ruby

Rubies older than 1.9.3-p429 will not compile with [Clang][clang] and require
[GCC][gcc] >= 4.2. Normally, Linux and BSD systems will already have GCC
installed. OS X users can install GCC via [homebrew]:

    brew tap homebrew/versions
    brew install gcc48

And run ruby-install again:

    ruby-install ruby 1.9.3-p125 -- CC=gcc-4.8

### Rubinius

[Rubinius] 1.x and 2.0.x is not supported due to multiple bugs.
Instead, please use Rubinius >= 2.1.x.

## Alternatives

* [RVM]
* [ruby-build]

## Endorsements

> I like the approach you're taking. Curious to see how it plays out.
